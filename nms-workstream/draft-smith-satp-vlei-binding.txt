                A SATP Core Binding for vLEI Identities
                  draft-smith-satp-vlei-binding-latest

Abstract

   The verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) is a cryptographically
   verifiable extension of the LEI standard, designed to automate trust
   in organizational identity.  Governed by the Global Legal Entity
   Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), the vLEI system uses W3C Verifiable
   Credentials, Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and Key Event Receipt
   Infrastructure (KERI) to issue and verify credentials for legal
   entities and their authorized representatives.  It enables secure,
   machine-readable identity assertions across financial, regulatory,
   and supply chain ecosystems, supporting role-based delegation and
   interoperability with decentralized trust frameworks.

   This specification defines vLEI for verifiable gateway operator
   identities and cryptographically links the gateway operator identity
   to the gateway identity.  Thus SATP core lock assertions are
   cryptographically linked to gateway operator identities.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

3.  Architecture

   The SATP core protocol [I-D.ietf-satp-core] defines several
   extensible protocol fields that may contain payload values not
   defined by SATP core.  To facilitate interoperability these fields
   SHOULD contain a media-type or content-format wrapper.  The following
   CDDL defines the wrapper and application to SATP fields.

   ; Reusable wrapper type
   msg-wrapper = {
     &(MTorCF) 0 => media-type-or-content-format,
     &(payload) 1 => bstr / tstr
   }

   media-type-or-content-format = tstr / int

   ; SATP credential-related fields
   verifiedOriginatorEntityId     = msg-wrapper / bstr / tstr
   verifiedRecipientEntityId      = msg-wrapper / bstr / tstr
   verifiedIntermediaryEntityIds  = [ + (msg-wrapper / bstr / tstr) ]
   verifiedTransactionId          = msg-wrapper / bstr / tstr
   verifiedCredential             = msg-wrapper / bstr / tstr
   verifiedPresentation           = msg-wrapper / bstr / tstr
   verifiedEvidence               = msg-wrapper / bstr / tstr
   verifiedSignature              = msg-wrapper / bstr / tstr

3.1.  Example SATP Credential Payload

   The following JSON document complies with the SATP CDDL schema using
   synthetic CESR payloads:

       "0": "application/cesr+json;profile=vlei",
       "1": "ACDC10JSON0000EDIG0AAA...SAID0AAA...i:did:keri:..."
     },
     "verifiedRecipientEntityId": {
       "0": "application/cesr+json;profile=vlei;base64=true",
       "1": "QUNEQzFBQUMwRkIuLi5FRElHMEFBQS4uLlNBSUQwQUFBLi4u"
     },
     "verifiedIntermediaryEntityIds": [

       },

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Media Type Registration: application/cesr+json

   Type name:  application

   Subtype name:  cesr+json

   Required parameters:  None

   Optional parameters:  profile — Indicates the credential conforms to
      a specific schema registry (e.g., "vlei")

      base64 — Indicates the CESR stream is base64-encoded for transport
      in JSON wrappers

      charset — Optional; default is UTF-8

   Encoding considerations:  8bit; CESR text encoding is UTF-8
      compatible and self-framing.

      When base64=true, the CESR stream is base64-encoded for safe
      embedding in JSON.

   Security considerations:  CESR payloads are cryptographically signed
      and self-framing.

      Signature verification is required to ensure authenticity and
      integrity.

      Schema SAIDs must be validated against the GLEIF vLEI Credential
      Schema Registry (https://www.gleif.org/media/pages/organizational-
      identity/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei/introducing-the-vlei-
      ecosystem-governance-framework/60ede5e451-1755158176/2023-12-
      15_vlei-egf-v3.0-technical-requirements-part-3-vlei-credential-
      schema-registry_v1.1-final.pdf).

      Credential provenance must be anchored to the GLEIF Root AID via
      ACDC edges.

   Interoperability considerations:  CESR supports dual text-binary
      encoding; this media type assumes CESR text encoding.

      When base64=true, payloads are safely embeddable in JSON-based
      SATP wrappers.

      Compatible with SATP, ACDC, and KERI protocols.
